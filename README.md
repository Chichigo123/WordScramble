# WordScramble
This is a mini project written by Rose Shane Palomo for her little brother RJ.
Find words using the jumbled letters and get a score totalling to the number of the words guessed.

The game has 3 difficulty levels, easy, average and difficult. Every new player starts at easy level.
And returning players can continue where they left off - although this feature is NOT YET AVAILABLE.

The goal of the player is to guess all words up to the difficult round.
